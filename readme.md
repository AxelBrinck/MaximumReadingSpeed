# Reading at maximum speed in .NET.

So what is the fastest way of reading in .NET?

This project is an example about how to implement the fastest reading method.
It is important to know that this can only be done using *unsafe code*.
Do not worry, as this is not unsafe by any means. It just unlocks pointer
capabilities and C-like programming in .NET.

You need to be sure that all resources used are correctly managed, 
as GC (Garbage Collector) will not be checking these memory addresses and you
could end up having memory-leaks and all sort of memory errors.

## Speed
Taking my old 2014 laptop with SSD, and my Google ProtoBuf repository as
references, they were both reading structured data at 31Mb/s.

With unsafe code and going *beyond* .NET, this method reaches 454/s.

```
Read Speed: 493.098Mb/s. Total: 1677721600 bytes.
```

Tweaking the unsafe section, you will be able to read structured data.
But the down-side is that is not very friendly to use. You may want to stick
with 64-bit or another primitive as your only type in your stream.

Still worth the implementation if your project is IO critical. As the main
benefit of this project is a very low CPU usage with a maximum HDD speed.

## Notes
Important not to use `Stream.Length`, it is the most inefficient way.
Instead, buffer the stream size and compare against that variable.

Maximum reading speed is achieved when compiling in release mode.
`dotnet run --configuration release`.

BitConverter .NET class ranks as second in my testings being 5% away from
unsafe reading.
